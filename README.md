# Logistic Regression with Python

## Problem Statement
To predict the survivors in titanic accident using classification model Logistic regression

## Data Set Brief : 
The titanic dataset has been taken [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) . This is a very famous data set. 

## Tasks:
1. Import Dataset
2. Perform necessary Data cleaning and EDA
3. Create visualisations to draw insights
4. Build a classification model for prediction.
5. Evaluate Results using relevant metrics

## Insights Drawn
1. Approximately 300 people survived while rest did not
2. There were more female survivors
3. Pclass3 had most people and least survivors in comparison to other classes
4. For Pclass3 there were least surviving men, however, for women this ratio was almost equal for the same class. Whereas, most number of women survivors are from Pclass1.
5. Model implemented predicted the results with 81% accuracy.
